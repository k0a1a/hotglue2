EDITING AND VIEWING MODES

  * to view the default page, simply navigate to the site's url (henceforth 
  referred to as "base url")
  * to view any other page, navigate to the base url with "?sitename" appended 
  to it (without quotes)
  * to start editing any page, simply navigate to the base url with 
  "?sitename/edit" appended to it (again, without quotes)
  * editing the default page is also possible by just navigating to the base url 
  plus "?edit (without quotes)

MENUS

  * clicking once on any empty space on a page in editing mode launches the 
  "new object" menu
  * you can select from a variety of object types by clicking on the 
  corresponding icon (hover with the mouse cursor over it to get a textual 
  description as well)
  * if you can't access any empty space, you can also launch this menu by 
  pressing [alt] and [o]
  * new objects are created on the spot where you launched the menu
  
  * by clicking twice on any empty space on a page in editing mode the "page" 
  menu gets displayed
  * there you can change general properties of the page you are editing, like 
  its background color
  * if you can't access any empty space, you can also launch this menu by 
  pressing [alt] and [p]
  
  * clicking anywhere outside the menu lets you close any opened menu again
  * when clicking on the page's empty space to close a menu, it doesn't get 
  immediately opened again; you can, however, doubleclick when the "new object" 
  menu is shown in order to get to the "page" menu

OBJECTS

  * all of the page's content comes in form of objects
  * these can objects come in various types, such as the ones that are listed in 
  the "new" menu
  * any change to objects (or general page properties for that matter) get 
  immediately reflected on the server and is shown to anyone who navigates to 
  the page; there is thus no need to "save" any of your changes as the system 
  takes care about this for you

OBJECT SELECTION

  * you can select an object by (left) clicking on it
  * selected objects have a red-ish selection border
  
  * pressing the [tab] key lets the selection cycle between all objects on the 
  page
  * this is especially handy when you have larger number of objects, or objects 
  that are hard to reach (like partly off-screen) or when you work with many 
  layers
  * the page is automatically scrolled to the newly selected object after 
  pressing [tab]
  
  * you can select multiple objects by pressing [shift] and (left) clicking on 
  one or more additional objects
  * these object then share the selection border
  * when you have multiple objects selected you can move or delete all of them 
  at the same time (the latter only through the keyboard, though)
  * in order to deselect a selected item hold [shift] and (left) click on the 
  object in question again
  
  * to deselect any selected items (left) click on an empty space on the page
  * you can also press [ctrl] and [d] to do the same
  
  * pressing [ctrl]+[a] selects all objects at once
  * pressing [ctrl]+[i] inverts the current selection (i.e. objects that were 
  not selected get selected and vice versa)

MOVING OBJECTS

  * you can (left) click on any object (selected or not) and drag it while still 
  holding down the mouse button to move it around
  * release the mouse button to place it at its current location
  
  * when an object is selected, you can also use the four arrow keys to move the 
  object around
  * by default, pressing one of the arrow keys briefly moves the object by 1 
  pixel
  * you can hold the arrow key down for a longer period of course
  * by holding [shift] while pressing any of the arrow keys, the object is moved 
  by the current grid step (more on this later; the default is 50 pixels) in the 
  right direction
  
  * when you press [shift] while moving an object with the mouse the object's 
  movements are constrained to the horizontal or vertical axis of its original 
  position
  
  * when multiple objects are selected these can be moved together as well 
  (they might look a bit jittery but their relative positions will be alright 
  when you release the mouse button)

CONTEXTMENUS

  * when an object gets selected its contextmenu gets shown as well
  * the contextmenu consists of a vertical column of icons and a horizontal row, 
  both starting at the upper left corner of the object
  * the vertical column consists of properties that are common to most if not 
  all object types, the horizontal row consists of properties specific to the 
  type of the object
  
  * when you start to move an object the contextmenu gets automatically hidden, 
  it will reappear after the movement has stopped
  * there is no contextmenu shown when two or more objects are selected at the 
  same time

COMMON OBJECT PROPERTIES

  * these are to be found in the vertical column of the context menu
  * hovering with the mouse cursor over any of these icons gives you more 
  information
  
  * clone object (sheep icon): create a duplicate of the current object; the 
  duplicate gets placed one grid step to the right and down from the current 
  object, it's also getting automatically selected
  
  * change transparency: click and drag the mouse to the left or right to change 
  the object's opacity; clicking the icon without dragging resets the opacity 
  back to its default (100%); you can hover with the mouse over the icon to see 
  the current opacity in the tooltip
  
  * move the object to the foreground or background: by default, all newly 
  created objects have a z-index value of 100. how they overlap is determined by 
  their order in the document - whereby newer objects are on top of older ones.
  using this icon you can, however, create an arbitrary stacking: clicking and 
  dragging the mouse to the left by more than 15 pixels makes the current 
  object appear behind all objects that are intersecting it, dragging it to the 
  right by more than 15 pixels makes it appear in front of them. Any value 
  between retains the current z-index value.
  * pressing [shift] and [pageup] or [pagedown] also moves any selected object 
  to the front/back
  * The actual z-index values that end up being used are determined by the 
  system (which also does things like reusing unused z-index levels etc).
  
  * make the object a link: you can turn (almost) all objects into hyperlinks 
  using this icon; in the input field that pops up you can make the object 
  point to arbitrary webpages (by specifying a canonical url, such as 
  http://www.disney.com/), but also other pages on this HOTGLUE installation 
  (by entering their page name) and even anchors on the same site (by entering 
  their name preceded by "#" (without quotes))
  * links have no effect while editing, but when accessing the site in viewing 
  mode you will find the object be turned into an hyperlink
  * by placing an empty string in the input field and pressing "OK" you can 
  remove links again
  
  * get the name of this object: when clicking an input fild pops up that have 
  the name of the local object in it; copy this string and paste it as the link 
  of any other object (see above)
  * be not fooled by the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons - you actually can't change 
  the name of the object here by design :)
  
  * make this object appear on all pages: clicking this icon creates a reference 
  (symlink) of the current object on all other pages on this HOTGLUE installation 
  that happen to exist at the time; these reference objects appear on these pages 
  like regular objects would, but all of them reference the same single object 
  file - hence doing changes to one of them makes them simultaneously appear on 
  all other pages as well.
  * this feature is very handy for creating a shared menu, header or footer that 
  you want to have on all pages.
  * when you delete an object that really is a reference (symlink) to an object 
  on another page, only this single reference gets deleted and no changes made 
  to the original object. this way you can, for example, remove a menu from a 
  small subset of pages again after creating references on all pages.
  * be aware, however not do delete the original object as this would make the 
  object disappear from all pages.
  
  * delete object: clicking this icon deletes the current object
  * you can also press [del] to do the same (this also works for deleting 
  multiple objects at once, when no contextmenu is being shown

OBJECT TYPES: TEXT

  * select the text icon in the "new object" menu to create a text object
  * text objects have a background color by default which gets randomly chosen 
  from a few presets (see OBJECT_DEFAULT_COLORS in config.inc.php)
  
  * when a text object is selected and you click once more on it, the object's 
  content is turned into a textarea, allowing you to edit its content
  * while editing the content, certain global shortcuts (such as the arrow keys 
  to move objects or [del] to delete the object) don't work
  * deselect the object again (e.g. by clicking on an empty space) to stop 
  editing again
  * you can also press [esc] to stop editing while still retaining the object 
  selection
  
  * by default, the text object offers the following contextmenu items in the 
  horizontal bar at the top:
  
  * change background color: clicking this launches a color wheel at the lower 
  right corner of the window, allowing you to easily change the objects 
  background color by clicking and dragging
  * if you hover over one of the two markers on the color wheel, the current 
  color value (in hex-format) is shown in a tooltip
  * click anywhere outside the colorpicker to close it again
  * you can alternatively press [shift] while clicking the background color icon 
  to open up an input field that allows you to dial in a specific color code 
  (in hex- or rgb-format)
  
  * make the background transparent: click to make the background transparent
  
  * change font size: click and drag the mouse up or down to adjust the 
  current font size; clicking the icon without any dragging resets the font 
  size to the default; the icon's tooltip shows the current font size
  
  * change font color: as background color
  
  * change type face: click to cycle through different web font-families that 
  get applied to the object and its content
  * note that these fonts will probably look different on other operating 
  systems.
  
  * change font style: click to cycle through these font-styles that get applied 
  to the objects and its content: normal, bold, italic, bold+italic
  
  * change line height: click and drag the mouse up or down to adjust the 
  current line height; clicking the icon without any dragging resets the line 
  height to the default
  * the line height is internally saved in em units.
  
  * change letter spacing: click and drag the mouse up or down to adjust the 
  current letter spacing; clicking the icon without any dragging resets the 
  letter spacing to the default
  * letter spacing is also internally saved in em units.
  
  * change word spacing: click and drag the mouse up or down to adjust the 
  current word spacing; clicking the icon without any dragging resets the 
  word spacing to the default
  * word spacing is also internally saved in em units.
  
  * change text alignment: click to cycle though different alignments that get 
  applied to the object and its content: left, center, right, justify
  
  * change padding: click and drag the mouse to adjust the current padding 
  horizontally as well as vertically; pressing [shift] makes the padding 
  in both axis be the same; clicking the icon without any dragging resets the 
  padding to the default
  * extensive padding might make it impossible to edit the text object's content 
  - in this case remove the padding before you click to turn the content into a 
  textarea.

TEXT OBJECT CONTENTS

  * in text objects, you can either write regular plain text, valid html code 
  or a mixture of both. the system tries its best to figure it out for you.
  
  * pressing [shift] and [space] while editing a text object adds a 
  non-breakable space; (in viewing mode this is then encoded as &nbsp;)
  
  * by default, text breaks using [return] will automatically be converted into 
  html <br> elements outside the textarea (see TEXT_AUTO_BR in config.inc.php)
  
  * pressing [tab] while editing a text objects adds tabulator; while this does 
  not influence the rendered output of the object, the tab will be retained for 
  editing
  
  * there are a number of strings that are automatically substituted by the 
  system; it is preferable to use them instead of explicitly spelling out 
  e.g. the base url or the page's name, as they might unexpectedly change:
  
  * $BASEURL$ (or $baseurl$, same for all following): the site's base url
  * $GLUE$: the HOTGLUE version number (e.g. "1.0.0")
  * $OBJ$: the name of the current object (e.g. "page.rev.obj")
  * $PAGE$: the canonical name of the current page (e.g. "page.rev")
  * $PAGENAME$: the name of the current page (e.g. "page")
  * $PROT$: the protocol currently being used (either "http" or "https")
  * $REV": the current revision (e.g. "rev")
  
  * these substitutions can also be used when setting an object's link target
  
  * when using html code inside text objects, any relative urls in "src" or 
  "href" attributes are automatically made absolute by prepending the site's 
  base url in viewing mode
  
  * all input is retrieved and stored in UTF-8 format, which should allow for 
  support of international character sets regardless of the server configuration

RESIZING OBJECTS

  * a number of objects, such as text objects, images etc can be resized.
  
  * if you hover over any resizable object's lower right corner you get a mouse 
  cursor indicating this ability. simply (left) click and drag to resize, and 
  release the mouse cursor again to stop resizing.
  * pressing [shift] while resizing retains the object's proportions.
  
  * similarly, it is also possible to only modify the object's width or height 
  clicking and dragging the object's eastern or southern border.
  
  * when hovering over one of these borders or the lower right corner a tooltip 
  with the object's dimensions and position (both in pixels) gets shown.

OBJECT TYPES: IMAGES

  * to include an image file on a page, upload it to the server by opening the 
  "new object" menu and clicking the "upload a file" icon
  * in the file selection dialog that pops up select one or more image files
  * by default *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png and *.gif files are supported (or files that 
  have the mime-type image/jpeg, image/png or image/gif set).
  * a status bar lets you know how your upload is doing - you can hover over it 
  to see the current progress expressed in bytes and percent.
  * if your upload is exceeding the limits set in the configuration you will 
  receive an error message (look in the README file for more information).
  
  * HOTGLUE supports server-side resizing of images. by default, images that are 
  larger than 120% of your window dimensions while uploading are automatically 
  resized to 80% of the window's dimensions. (see IMAGE_UPLOAD_RESIZE_{LARGER,TO} 
  in config.inc.php)
  * all other uploaded images create an object that has the same width and 
  height as the original image file.
  * the server still keeps a copy of the original file that you uploaded, and 
  uses this one for any other resizing operation that you end up doing on that 
  object. this way you can entrust HOTGLUE for example with your high-resolution 
  photos and  always have images on your sites in the best possible quality 
  while not burning any bandwidth.
  * after the initial upload, any resizing of the image that results in the 
  object being smaller than the original file in both its width and height 
  triggers an automatic resizing operation on the server.
  
  * by default, images offer the following contextmenu items in the 
  horizontal bar at the top:
  
  * toggle image tiling: click to switch between stretching the image to fill 
  the object or tiling it; this of course only matters when the object size is 
  larger or smaller than the image.
  
  * reset image size: click to reset the object to the native size of the 
  (original) image file
  * if you press [shift] only the height gets adjusted to match the object's 
  current width
  * if you press [ctrl] only the width gets adjusted to match the object's 
  current height
  
  * adjust image selection: click and drag the mouse to change the position 
  of the image origin; clicking the icon without dragging resets the position of 
  origin
  
  * download original file: click to download the original (non-resized) file 
  back to your computer

OBJECT TYPES: EMBEDDED WEBSITES

  * select the "embed another webpage" icon on the "new object" menu; enter the 
  full canonical url of the page you wish to include into the input field that 
  pops up
  
  * embedded websites are inactive (shown with a greyish hue) in edit mode, but 
  regular visitors can interact with them

OBJECT TYPES: WEB VIDEOS

  * select the "embed a youtube or vimeo video" icon on the "new object" menu; 
  enter the full canonical url of the video you wish to embed (like 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mdVHEus0T8)
  
  * since adobe flash objects might be embedded in the webvideo object, you have to 
  click on the small handle (hand icon) in the object's top left corner in order 
  to select and move the object. if the handle is not accessible, try cycling 
  trough all objects using the [tab] key and move it to an position where the 
  handle is accessible using the arrow keys.
  
  * when a adobe flash object is used to embed the video, resizing of the 
  object might be difficult.
  
  * webvideo objects can be set to start playback automatically (autostart) and 
  looping can be enabled or disabled; both can be accomplished by clicking icons 
  in the contextmenu. they need a reload of the page to take effect.

UPLOADING FILES

  * uploading files can not only be done through the "new object" menu, but 
  also by simply dragging one or many files from your computer and dropping them 
  over the page you are editing. (this works at least on recent browser 
  versions..)
  
  * after the uploading is finished the system tries to convert these files into 
  any sensible object type and place these at the spot you dropped the files 
  (or launched the "new object" menu)
  
  * the system also takes care to handle duplicates, i.e. uploading the same 
  file twice results only in a single file in the page's shared directory, with 
  two objects referencing this file

UPLOADING FILES: DOWNLOAD OBJECT (FALLBACK)

  * if the system has no better way of dealing with the file you uploaded (based 
  on its file extension and mime-type), it is turned into a "download" object - 
  allowing for its (binary) download
  
  * by default, download objects only appear only in editing mode; if you want 
  any user to be able to access the file, make the object public by toggling the 
  related option in the download object's contextmenu (this can be changed back 
  at any time)
  
  * the download object shows any file extension that the original file had
  * hovering over the download object makes a tooltip with the object's name 
  and the original filename (before uploading) appear
  
  * the file content can be accessed by navigating (or linking) to 
  base url appended with "?" (without quotes) and the object's name if the 
  object is public or you are logged in
  * you can download the file through the object's contextmenu in any case

UPLOADING FILES: VIDEO OBJECT

  * by default, HOTGLUE can also handle html5 video files that are uploaded.
  
  * files having one of the following extensions are regarded as html5 videos: 
  *.ogv, *.ogg, *.h264, *.mp4, *.webm; additionally files having the following 
  mime-types set are also regarded as html5 videos: video/ogg, video/h264, 
  video/mp4, video/webm.
  
  * support for these container-formats and video-codecs varies in different 
  browsers: recent versions of Google Chrome support webm and ogg, as will 
  Firefox 4 when it's released (version 3.6 only supports ogg). Safari and 
  Internet Explorer 9 meanwhile only include support for h264.
  
  * the video objects allow the following customizations through the 
  contextmenu:
  
  * toggle automatic playback of video
  
  * toggle looping of video
  
  * show or hide control elements
  
  * mute or unmute video
  
  * reset video size
  
  * download original file

PAGE PROPERTIES

  * access the page menu by doubleclicking on an empty space on the page
  
  * change page title: click and change the page's title (the one that is 
  displayed in the browser's title bar)
  * the default page title is the name of the page (as in the url).
  
  * change the page's url: click and change the page's name, which in turns 
  determines the address to reach this page
  * modifying a page's name also changes the name (and address) of all its 
  revisions and resources (such as objects).
  * after renaming a page this way, you are automatically redirected to the 
  renamed page's editing mode.
  
  * make this the start page: click to make this page the one shown by default 
  when visitors navigate to your base url without specifying any particular page.
  no confirmation is shown as a result of this action.
  
  * change the background color: click to launch the color wheel; clicking 
  anywhere outside the wheel hides it again; if you have uploaded a background 
  image before you must first agree to remove it before being able to set a 
  background color
  
  * create a new page: click to create a new page and enter the desired page 
  name in the input field that pops up; you will be redirected to the new page's 
  editing mode
  
  * delete the page: click and confirm to delete the current page and all prior 
  revisions of it - there is no turning back. afterwards you will be redirected 
  to the list of all available pages.
  
  * upload a background image: click and select a single image file to upload 
  (same file formats and mime-types as for image objects). there is no status 
  bar displayed when uploading background images, but you should either see the
  image as your background or an error message.
  * when uploading a second image, the first one gets automatically deleted.
  
  * toggle between having the background fixed or having it scroll with the 
  rest of the page
  
  * adjust background image position: click and drag the mouse to change the 
  position of the image origin; clicking the icon without dragging resets the 
  position of origin
  
  * list all pages: navigate to a page that shows all available pages
  
  * compare revisions of this page: navigate to a pages that allows you to 
  visually compare different revisions of the same page
  
  * grid: click to show or hide the grid; click and drag the mouse to change 
  the grid's steps horizontally as well as vertically; press [shift] while 
  dragging to make the grid's steps be the same for horizontal as well as 
  vertical
  * the grid's steps are saved and shared among all pages on the installation
  * if enabled, the grid reacts to changes of the page's background-color 
  in order to remain visible

PAGE BROWSER

  * the page browser can be accessed through the "page" menu or by navigating 
  to the base url appended with "?pages" (without quotes)
  
  * the page browser gives you a list of all available pages sorted by name and 
  lets you jump to the editing or viewing mode of any of them, as well as 
  renaming, deleting them or setting one of them as the start page

REVISIONS

  * HOTGLUE automatically creates snapshots (revisions) of the pages that you 
  are editing based on its configuration.
  
  * by default, a new revision is created whenever the user navigates to the 
  page's editing mode, and the prior revision is older than 1 hour and the 
  current (head) revision differs from the prior revision (see 
  SNAPSHOT_MIN_AGE in config.inc.php)
  * since new revisions are created when the user navigates to editing mode, 
  you can of course also trigger this manually by pressing refresh ([f5]).
  
  * by default, revisions are automatically being deleted after 7 days (see 
  SHAPSHOT_MAX_AGE).
  
  * the system takes care of keeping uploaded files in the shared folder as 
  long as revisions reference them, and automatically deletes them when this 
  is not the case anymore.
  * it is thus suggested not to manually delete files in shared directories 
  or revisions in the pages' directories. (if you don't need revisions you 
  can turn them off completely by setting SNAPSHOT_MIN_AGE to zero)
  
  * since snapshotting aims to preserve the entire look and content of a page 
  at a particular time, it also turns objects on other pages that are referenced 
  (symlinks) into first class citizens by copying their content.

REVISIONS BROWSER

  * the page browser can be accessed through the "page" menu or by navigating 
  to the base url appended with "?pagename/revisions" (without quotes)
  
  * using the controls in the window's lower right corner you can navigate 
  between all revisions of the page
  * pressing the left and right arrow keys is also supported
 
  * clicking "revert" makes this revision the page's new current (head) revision
  * after clicking revert you will be redirected to the editing mode of the 
  newly reverted revision (what is now your new head revision) :)
  * obviously you cannot revert to the head revision.

SHORT URLS

  * when the htaccess-dist file got renamed into .htaccess (and you host supports 
  this as well) you are able to leave out the question mark in the urls above.
