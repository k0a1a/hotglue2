SERVER REQUIREMENTS

  * Apache 2.x
  * PHP 5.x
  * (optional) mod_rewrite (for short URLs)
  * (optional) php5-gd (for server-side image resizing)
  
  The current version of Hotglue was only extensively tested on Linux hosts.


CLIENT REQUIREMENTS

  * for editing: Mozilla Firefox (>= 3.6) or Google Chrome (>= 8.0)
  
  While we haven't tested it, editing could also work on any recent Safari version.
  
  * for viewing: the above plus Internet Explorer 8 (but keep IE8_COMPAT in the 
    config set to true)


INSTALLING HOTGLUE

  * copy the directory of the tarball to a directory that is accessible to the 
    server
  * make sure the webserver can write to the content directory and all contained 
	files (e.g. by running "chmod -R 0777 content" in the directory that you just copied the files to)
  * it is recommended that you create a user-config.inc.php file where you 
    can overwrite the settings defined in config.inc.php. the former file won't 
    get overwritten by future updates.
  * make sure that you at least set AUTH_PASSWORD to a non-default value.
  * (optional) if your hosting environment allows you to use mod_rewrite and 
    you want to use short URLs for your pages, you can rename the htaccess-dist 
    file to .htaccess (e.g. by running "move htaccess-dist .htaccess")
  
  and finally
  
  * launch the directory's URL from a browser and add "?edit" to the address 
    (e.g. http://myserver.com/hotglue/?edit) to start editing
    
  If you are using the optional .htaccess file you can also start editing by 
  just adding "edit" (e.g. http://myserver.com/hotglue/edit).


DEBUGGING HOTGLUE

  If something breaks and you want to troubleshoot the problem it is helpful to 
  turn on PHP error reporting by setting or adding "error_reporting(E_ALL);" to 
  your user-config.inc.php file.
  You can also set the LOG_LEVEL (see config.inc.php) to 'debug' in order to get 
  an overwhelming amount of logging information written to your log file, which 
  by default is in the content directory.
  Requests from the client start in the log file with "--- request ---" and AJAX 
  requests with "--- json request ---". If you report a problem, make sure you 
  send with it only the relevant pieces of logging information (like the request 
  and all associated AJAX request that get written when the problem occurs).
